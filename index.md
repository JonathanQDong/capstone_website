# Introduction
Researchers in the health world are always looking at new ways to develop new drugs to help combat evolving diseases, as an article by Jim O'Neill in 2016 stated that "By 2050, drug-resistant pathogens are expected to be the leading cause of death in the world". A great example that would reinforce this statement would be the emergence of COVID-19 and its variants which have caused the deaths of millions of people around the globe. When taken in consideration with other notable diseases such as swine flu, ebola, HIV, etc, it would ever so emphasize the need to quickly devlop drugs that would help to limit them and their mutations/evolutions.

One avenue that researchers have been looking into has been anitmicrobial peptides (AMPs), chains of amino acids that
